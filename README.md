# CSharpFundamentalsWithExamples

## Project Overview

This repository contains examples of fundamental **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** implemented in **C#**. The project is organized into different categories such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Sorting Algorithms, and Searching Algorithms. Each category includes both the core logic and executable examples that can be run via a console application.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Algorithms (Class Library)**
   - **Sorting**: Contains various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
   - **Searching**: Implements searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
   - **Miscellaneous**: Other common algorithms like Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), Fibonacci, etc.

### 2. **DataStructures (Class Library)**
   - **Arrays**: Examples of common array operations, such as reversing arrays, finding min/max, etc.
   - **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked list operations and examples.
   - **StacksAndQueues**: Stack and queue operations with implementations using arrays and linked lists.
   - **TreesAndGraphs**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and graph algorithms.

### 3. **FundamentalsRunner (Console Application)**
   This is the central console application used to run and test all the data structure and algorithm examples from the class libraries. It provides an easy-to-use interface to choose and execute different examples.

   - **RunAlgorithms**: Runs the algorithm examples.
   - **RunDataStructures**: Runs the data structure examples.
   - **Utilities**: Helper classes for input/output formatting and handling.

### 4. **Utilities (Class Library)**
   - **ConsolePrinter**: A utility for consistent, formatted console output.
   - **InputOutputHelper**: Helper class for managing user input and output handling.
